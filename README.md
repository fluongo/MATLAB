# MATLAB
A repository for all MATLAB code

This repository will hold the bare minimum matlab code to run the data from calcium imaging experiments

I am tentatively planning on splitting it into 

Workflow - This will consist of the minimal files necessary to go from movies to rasters
Pattern Recognition - The code for identifying synfire chains
Correlation Analysis - Correlation functions and surrogate generation
Network Analysis - Things such as cc and surrogate generation
Paper figures - Scripts used to generate certain figures


This code is written with the assumption of mapping the sohal server as a network drive on windows with letter Z
